SidplayerFp - a GUI Sid player that is based on sidplayfp

Requirements

64 bit Windows (Windows 7 & Windows 10 & Windows 11 tested)
A CPU with atleast 4 cores is preferable, If need arises to lower cpu demands, there is an alternative in the settings that limit use to one sid chip instead of three that can help lower cpu load.SidplyerFp will thereby use one sidchip for sid files designed for one sid chip BUT will use all three if the sid file being played is designed to use 3 sid chips, much like SidPlayFp originally behaves.

STIL support
Play list
Drag n drop sid files, folder with sids or SidplayerFp play lists to SidplayerFp or play list window
